# Markdown syntax documentation

- Jekyll uses [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) which is a superset of Markdown.
- For math support see [MathJax documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html). Please note that
  - [MathJax supports only the math-mode commands from Latex](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/differences.html),
  - [we have enabled single $ as math delimiter](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/delimiters.html)
